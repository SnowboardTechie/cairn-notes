# cairn-notes — Agent Framework

This file documents the conventions agents follow in the cairn-notes system. It is written in `AGENTS.md` format for cross-tool portability (Claude Code, Cursor, Aider, Codex, etc.). Claude Code can reference it via `@AGENTS.md` import in `CLAUDE.md`.

---

## Identity

User identity lives at `~/.claude/cairn/config.md` and is populated by the `/cairn-setup` slash command on first use. Agents read this file at invocation to resolve `{{USER_NAME}}`, `{{TIMEZONE}}`, `{{PERSONAL_VAULT}}`, `{{WORKING_HOURS}}`, `{{COGNITIVE_PEAK}}`, and `{{PRONOUNS}}`.

**If identity is missing:** the invoked skill (or spoke, when reached directly) tells the user to run `/cairn-setup` and stops. Skills don't bootstrap identity inline — `/cairn-setup` owns that flow.

Never hard-code user-specific values in agent bodies.

---

## Architecture

cairn-notes is **slash commands on top, helper spokes underneath**. Users invoke skills; skills delegate to spokes via Task when context-isolation, parallelism, reusability, or specialized persona warrants it.

```
                  User invokes a slash command
                              │
                              ▼
 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │  Slash commands (skills)                                        │

                                  ▼
 ┌─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
 │  Helper spokes (not user-facing)                                │
 │                                                                 │

 │  impl-reviewer    ticket-analyst                                │
 └─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
```

Spokes are **skill-invokable, not user-invokable**. Each spoke's `description:` frontmatter names the skills that call it; if a user reaches a spoke directly, the spoke redirects them to the appropriate slash command. Scribe is never invoked directly — the calling skill gathers the context scribe needs (note type, title, related notes) before delegating.

### Spoke roster

- **scribe** — note persistence (only writer in the system); invoked by `/capture`, `meeting-sync`, `session-review`
- **archivist** — past-note retrieval from `.notes/` and the personal vault; invoked by `/recall`, `/capture` (pre-link), `meeting-sync`, `session-review`
- **sage** — external research (web, docs, code examples); invoked by skills that need current external grounding
- **pyre** — note deletion with tiered confirmation; invoked by cleanup flows
- **forge** — daily planning (goal-mode by default, blocks/schedules opt-in); invoked by `/plan-workday`, `/plan-week`
- **kindle** — flow-barrier coaching (anxiety / boredom / distraction); invoked by `/plan-workday` and forge
- **scout** — developer-forge activity (PR reviews, issues, own PRs, mentions) from GitHub via `gh` or Forgejo via `tea`; invoked by `/plan-workday` and `/plan-week` before forge
- **impl-reviewer** — single-lens implementation review (correctness / security / simplicity); invoked by `pr-self-review` and `issue-work`
- **ticket-analyst** — fetches and digests a GitHub/Forgejo issue or PR into a structured context file; invoked by `issue-work`

### When to add a new spoke (subagent) vs. keep work in a skill

A new spoke is warranted only when at least one applies:

1. **Context isolation** — the work reads many files or produces large synthesis that would bloat main context.
2. **Parallelism** — independent units that can fan out (spawn N spokes in parallel, each returning its own artifact).
3. **Reusability** — multiple skills would invoke the same worker.
4. **Specialized persona** — a distinct prompt/frame improves the output (not just tool-level calls).

If none apply, the work stays in the invoking skill. Interactive multi-turn flows (user Q&A loops, triage) are the wrong shape for spokes — spokes return a single artifact, not a conversation. MCPs and skills cover architectures that look agent-shaped but aren't: MCP for tool surfaces exposed to many agents; skill for user-facing orchestration.

When an existing spoke already does adjacent reasoning, prefer a sibling skill over extending the spoke — even if the criteria above would otherwise warrant spoke shape. Spokes derive value from focus; spreading forge's daily-goal sequencing into life-spanning option ranking dilutes its current value. Surfaced while drafting [#73](https://github.com/SnowboardTechie/cairn-notes/issues/73).

### Parallel agents write to distinct output paths

When spawning parallel Task or Explore agents, each agent needs its own output destination — never a shared file that multiple agents append to. Concurrent appends interleave silently and corrupt the output; file locking isn't reliable across agent boundaries. Two safe shapes:

- **File-per-agent** — the orchestrator picks a unique filename per agent (e.g., `explore-{area-slug}.md`); each agent writes its single file; the orchestrator reads them back for synthesis. See [issue-work/SKILL.md](skills/issue-work/SKILL.md) Phase 2.1.
- **Return-by-message** — each agent returns its findings in the Task result; the orchestrator synthesizes into a single file. See [session-review/SKILL.md](skills/session-review/SKILL.md) Step 2.

Do not instruct parallel agents to "append to `shared.md` under a `## Area: {name}` heading" — that shape invites the anti-pattern the *Parallelism* criterion above is describing.

## Notes System

### Vault discovery

Agents discover vaults at runtime by listing `~/notes/*/`. No vault names are hard-coded beyond the `second-brain` default for personal notes.

### Vault routing

| You're in | Insight is about | Write to |
|---|---|---|
| Project repo | This project | `.notes/` (→ `~/notes/{project}/`) |
| Project repo | Cross-project or personal | `~/notes/second-brain/` |
| `~/notes/second-brain/` | A specific project | `~/notes/{project}/` |
| `~/notes/second-brain/` | Personal / cross-cutting | `./` |
| Anywhere else | Anything | `~/notes/second-brain/` |

### Auto-setup

If an agent is invoked in a git repo without a `.notes/` symlink:
1. Create `~/notes/{project-name}/` if missing
2. Create `.notes` symlink in the trunk (never in a worktree)
3. Add `.notes` to `.gitignore` if not present
4. Proceed

If `~/notes/second-brain/` is missing on first personal-note write, auto-create it.

### Worktree resolution

Agents resolve the **trunk root** (not the current worktree) before any `.notes/` operation. `.notes` lives only in the trunk. All worktrees share it. See the `agent-workspace` skill for the resolution protocol.

---

## Working State vs Permanent Notes

- `.notes/` — permanent knowledge: ideas, explorations, decisions worth keeping
- `.notes/.agents/` — working state: task context, drafts, research cache

Working files live under `.notes/.agents/{skill}/` and are cleaned up when tasks complete. The `.agents/` prefix hides them from Obsidian's default view.

### Vault reads must filter dot-prefixed dirs

Skills that read markdown files from user vaults via file globs (Obsidian sources, wiki links, bulk scans) **must exclude any path with a segment starting with `.`**. This mirrors Obsidian's own UI semantics (hidden dirs: `.obsidian/`, `.trash/`, and the plugin's own `.agents/` working state).

Why it matters: `.agents/` holds files like `forge/today.md` — feeding an agent's own output back in as planning context creates a silent feedback loop that degrades over days. Shell globs don't filter dotfiles by default; post-filter the result list unless the source explicitly opts in (e.g., an `include_hidden: true` config field).

---

## Subagent Output Verification (mandatory)

Subagent output is **unverified**. Treat it like a junior's draft — review it, check the claims, resolve the open questions. Never relay it to the user without verification.

**Before presenting any subagent finding:**
1. If a finding references a file → read the file yourself
2. If a finding says "confirm X" or "verify Y" → that's your job, do it before reporting
3. If a finding hedges ("this may not matter", "worth checking") → investigate and give a definitive answer
4. If a finding doesn't pass a basic smell test → look at the actual code before repeating it

This applies to all delegated work: code reviews, exploration results, research summaries, implementation output. You are the senior engineer. The subagent is a tool. Verify before you report.

---

## Capture Triggers

These are the moments worth capturing — the point of cairn-notes is low-friction capture, and `/capture` is the primary surface for it. Other skills (`meeting-sync`, `session-review`) capture during their own flows; main Claude can invoke `/capture` directly when a signal lands mid-conversation.

| Signal | Note type | Action |
|---|---|---|
| Insight emerges | IDEA | `/capture <insight>` (or scribe Task with type=IDEA) |
| Topic explored deeply | EXPLORATION | `/capture exploration: …` at natural pause |
| Choice made | DECISION | `/capture decision: …` — record choice and rationale |
| Session ending, was valuable | SESSION | `/capture session: …` summary before close |
| Same topic 3+ times | THREAD | `/capture thread: …` — connect the dots |
| Checking ticket/PR status | TASK | `/capture task: …` — update or create task note |
| Blocker identified | TASK | `/capture task: …` — capture blocker + timeline |

Scribe writes immediately on invocation. No previews, no confirmation prompts — the calling skill (e.g., `/capture`) owns any approval gate.

**Scope.** This table covers *vault-note capture* — durable, project-specific knowledge written into Obsidian by `@scribe`. Cross-project user-collaboration preferences (how the user thinks, anchors, decides) route to the harness memory system, not the vault — see `skills/session-review/SKILL.md` for the collaboration-lens flow. Plugin-misbehavior signal (a cairn-notes agent or skill that misbehaved or has a sharp edge worth filing) routes to a GitHub issue against this repo via `/issue-create` — see the same skill for the plugin-improvement-lens flow.

## Git & Commits

- **No AI attribution in commits.** Never add `Co-authored-by: Claude`, `Co-Authored-By: Claude Code`, `Generated with`, or similar. The human is the sole author.
- **Atomic commits.** Small, focused commits grouped by concern, not by time.
- **Never commit unverified work.** Confirm builds pass, tests pass, no regressions before committing.
- **Feature branches + PR only.** Never commit directly to `main`/`master`. In this repo (`SnowboardTechie/cairn-notes`), `main` is branch-protected — direct pushes are rejected with "Changes must be made through a pull request." Even when the user says "commit to main," the mechanical path is: feature branch → `gh pr create` → merge. That satisfies the user's intent within the repo's rules.
- **Changelog-first, release-on-bump.** This repo follows [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.1.0/) + SemVer. Version bumps happen on *release* PRs, not on every change. `version-check` CI enforces both halves.

  **Versionable paths** (changes here require a `CHANGELOG.md` update; everything else is exempt):
  - `plugins/cairn-notes/agents/*`
  - `plugins/cairn-notes/commands/*`
  - `plugins/cairn-notes/skills/*`
  - `plugins/cairn-notes/AGENTS.md`
  - `plugins/cairn-notes/CLAUDE.md`
  - `plugins/cairn-notes/.claude-plugin/*`
  - repo-root `.claude-plugin/*`

  **Non-release PR (the common case).** Add a bullet under `## [Unreleased]` in `CHANGELOG.md` describing the change. Do **not** bump `plugin.json`. CI just needs `CHANGELOG.md` in the diff.

  **Fixed is for previously-shipped behavior only.** Within `[Unreleased]`, entries belong under **Fixed** only if they describe a change to behavior users could have seen in a prior release. Mid-PR iteration — fixes to code added on the same branch that never landed on `main` — folds into the **Added**/**Changed** bullet that describes the new feature. Readers skimming a release changelog never experienced the pre-fix state, so a separate Fixed bullet is noise. Squash-merge preserves the iteration trail in `git log`.

  **Release PR (when cutting `vX.Y.Z`).** All of the following, in the same PR:
  1. Bump `plugins/cairn-notes/.claude-plugin/plugin.json` `version` → `X.Y.Z`.
  2. Promote `[Unreleased]` contents under a new `## [X.Y.Z] — YYYY-MM-DD` heading; reset `[Unreleased]` to `_No unreleased changes._`.
  3. Add footer: `[X.Y.Z]: https://github.com/SnowboardTechie/cairn-notes/releases/tag/vX.Y.Z`.
  4. Retarget: `[Unreleased]: https://github.com/SnowboardTechie/cairn-notes/compare/vX.Y.Z...HEAD`.
  5. **After merge**, create the tag + GitHub release: `gh release create vX.Y.Z --target <merge-sha> --title "vX.Y.Z — <summary>" --notes-file <notes>`. Without this step the footer link 404s.

  Files outside the versionable list — README, CONTRIBUTING, CHANGELOG itself (when it's the only thing touched), LICENSE, `.github/` — are exempt from the CHANGELOG requirement. See `.github/workflows/version-check.yml` for the exact rules.

- **GitHub Actions hardening baseline.** Every workflow under `.github/workflows/` ships with both of these blocks at the top level:

  ```yaml
  permissions:
    contents: read          # or the narrowest set the job actually needs

  concurrency:
    group: {workflow-name}-${{ github.ref }}
    cancel-in-progress: true
  ```

  Default-token least-privilege and ref-level run de-duplication. `docs-lint.yml` conforms; `version-check.yml` predates the rule and is a backfill candidate.

## Skill Authoring

### Positive prompts for approval gates

When a skill reaches an action gate (open a PR, publish a note, post to Slack, send an email), script the question positively — ask what the skill wants to do and list the accepted replies. Don't state the prohibition and leave the orchestrator to invent the prompt shape.

Write:

> Ask: *"Ready to push and open the draft PR? [yes / wait]"*. Wait for explicit approval. Treat silence or ambiguity as a re-prompt, not as approval.

Not:

> Do not auto-open the PR. User approves ship.

Prohibitions leave the orchestrator to fill the positive shape, which often lands as a silent stop — the user has to pull the thread ("why did you stop?") to get moving. Discovered in [#10](https://github.com/SnowboardTechie/cairn-notes/issues/10) / [#31](https://github.com/SnowboardTechie/cairn-notes/pull/31); `issue-work/SKILL.md` Phase 4.3 was rewritten from the negative form to the positive form.

### Per-user config vs per-project state vs plugin-local

Three storage surfaces. The decision rule is: "does this vary by user?" → `~/.claude/cairn/`. "Does this vary by project?" → `.notes/.agents/{skill}/`. "Neither?" → ship it in the plugin body.

| Surface | Varies by | Examples |
|---|---|---|
| `~/.claude/cairn/*.md` | User (name, vault path, working hours, source lists) | `config.md` (via `/cairn-setup`), `planning-sources.md` (via `/plan-workday`) |
| `.notes/.agents/{skill}/` | Project (per-repo caches, drafts, session context) | `.notes/.agents/drafts/`, `.notes/.agents/issue-create/type-ids.md` |
| Plugin body (`SKILL.md`, `references/`) | Neither — ships with the plugin | Static instruction text, example templates |

Per-user config files are bootstrapped by the owning skill on first use (prompt → write → proceed), matching the `/cairn-setup` pattern. Per-project state uses the worktree-aware trunk-resolution protocol from [agent-workspace/SKILL.md](skills/agent-workspace/SKILL.md).

### Shared config: preserve foreign keys

When one skill owns a `~/.claude/cairn/*.md` config file and a sibling skill extends it with its own nested key (e.g., `weekly-planning` adds `weekly_planning:` to `workday-planning`'s `planning-sources.md`), the owner's bootstrap/rewrite path must preserve top-level frontmatter keys it doesn't own. A bootstrap that writes the file from scratch will silently drop sibling-skill keys and break the sibling with no error.

Pattern: before emitting the final YAML, read the existing file, extract every top-level key outside the owner's schema, and splice those pairs back into the assembled frontmatter. Show the full preserved YAML in the confirmation prompt so a mis-preservation is caught before the write. Add a Guardrail like "Do NOT drop top-level frontmatter keys this skill doesn't own" so future changes don't regress.

Surfaced in [#39](https://github.com/SnowboardTechie/cairn-notes/issues/39) / [#40](https://github.com/SnowboardTechie/cairn-notes/pull/40); implemented as `workday-planning/SKILL.md` Bootstrap Flow Step 0.

### Command files vs. skill auto-registration

A plugin skill at `skills/<name>/SKILL.md` is auto-registered as both `/<name>` and `/cairn-notes:<name>` by Claude Code — no command file required. Adding a `commands/<name>.md` file with the **same name** as a skill shadows that auto-registration and breaks the bare form (`/<name>` returns "Unknown command"), while the namespaced form keeps working.

Decide by role:

| `commands/<name>.md` role | Same-name skill exists? | Keep the command file? |
|---|---|---|
| Full implementation (the command IS the logic) | No | Yes — it's the only surface |
| Alias to a differently-named skill (e.g., `/plan-workday` → `workday-planning`) | No (different name) | Yes — it's a user-facing shortcut |
| Shim that just re-invokes a same-named skill | Yes | **No** — delete it; auto-reg handles both forms |

Surfaced in [#49](https://github.com/SnowboardTechie/cairn-notes/pull/49) (v0.4.2) after `/issue-create` failed across every worktree despite shipping both a command file and a skill. Removing the shims restored the bare form without regressing the namespaced form.

---

## PR Review Comments

When posting review comments to a forge (GitHub, Gitea, Forgejo), **always post as inline comments on specific files and lines** — never as a single bulk review body. Each finding is its own comment anchored to the relevant code so the author sees it in context. The review body itself should be a short summary only.

---

## Cross-Tool Compatibility

This plugin is designed primarily for Claude Code but uses `AGENTS.md` format so the conventions port to Cursor, Aider, Codex, and other tools that respect this file. The agents and skills themselves are Claude Code-specific, but forks for other platforms can use this file as the shared spec.

The repo-level [`core/AGENTS.md`](../../core/AGENTS.md) defines the host-agnostic / host-specific boundary — what eventually belongs under `core/` versus what stays in this plugin (or a future per-host adapter). New skill or agent contributions that are pure prose are host-agnostic candidates; anything calling Claude Code tools (`AskUserQuestion`, host-specific `Bash` shapes) or reading `~/.claude/` config paths is host-specific. Migration of existing content is tracked under the [portability epic](https://github.com/SnowboardTechie/cairn-notes/issues/22).
